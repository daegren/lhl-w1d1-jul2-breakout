## Sublime & Terminal

> For windows use `CTRL` instead of `CMD` (âŒ˜)

- Open all projects as folders
  - This will give you the ability to switch between files quite easily
- `CMD-C`, `CMD-X`, `CMD-V`: Copy, Cut, Paste
- `CMD-T`: Open a file in the current project.
- `CMD-P`: Command pallete
- `CMD-Z`: Undo (Your best friend)

### `subl` helper

- [Mac OS](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html)

### `$PATH` Environment Variable

## Code Demo

## Paired Programming

- Reasoning:
  - Gives better code quality, two pairs of eyes on the code before it goes out
  - Allows developers to share knowledge of how features are being developed.
- Roles:
  - Driver: Is writing the code, thinking about syntax and structure
  - Navigator: Is thinking about the big picture, what are the things that are coming up
